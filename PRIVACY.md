# Privacy Policy for Horizon

**Last Updated:** January 2025

## Overview

Horizon is a personal task tracking application designed to help you manage your daily tasks with minimal friction. Your privacy is important to us, and this policy explains how your data is handled.

## Data Collection

### What We Collect
- **Tasks and Task Data**: All tasks you create, including task names, descriptions, due dates, recurrence patterns, tags, and completion history
- **Settings and Preferences**: Your app preferences, display settings, and Google Drive connection status (if enabled)
- **Widget Data**: Task information exported to iOS home screen widgets

### What We DON'T Collect
- ❌ No analytics or usage tracking
- ❌ No advertising identifiers
- ❌ No location data
- ❌ No personal information beyond what you enter in tasks
- ❌ No third-party tracking
- ❌ No behavioral data collection

## Data Storage

### Local Storage
By default, all your data is stored **locally on your device only**. Your tasks never leave your device unless you explicitly enable Google Drive synchronization.

### Optional Google Drive Sync
If you choose to enable Google Drive synchronization:
- Your task data is stored in **your personal Google Drive account**
- Data is stored in a dedicated application folder in your Google Drive
- Only you have access to this data through your Google account
- We do not have access to your Google Drive data
- You can disconnect Google Drive sync at any time from Settings
- Disconnecting does not delete data from your Google Drive; you retain full control

## Data Security

- All data stored on your device uses iOS's secure app sandbox
- Google Drive sync uses OAuth 2.0 authentication (no passwords stored in the app)
- Network communication with Google Drive uses HTTPS encryption
- We do not store your Google credentials

## Data Sharing

**We do not share, sell, or transfer your data to any third parties.** Period.

The only external service that has access to your data is Google Drive, and only if you explicitly enable synchronization. In that case, data is stored in your personal Google Drive account under your control.

## Your Rights

You have complete control over your data:
- **Access**: All your data is visible in the app
- **Export**: You can access your task data in your Google Drive (if sync is enabled)
- **Delete**: You can delete individual tasks or all data at any time
- **Disconnect**: You can disconnect Google Drive sync from Settings
- **Uninstall**: Deleting the app removes all local data from your device

## Children's Privacy

Horizon is not directed at children under 13. We do not knowingly collect data from children under 13.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Changes will be posted with an updated "Last Updated" date. Continued use of the app after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.

**In Short**: Your tasks are yours. We don't collect, track, or share your data. Period.
