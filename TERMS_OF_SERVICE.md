By accessing and using Horizon (the "App"), you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service. If you do not agree to abide by the above, please do not use this service.

## 2. Use License

Permission is granted to temporarily download one copy of the materials (information or software) on Horizon for personal, non-commercial transitory viewing only. This is the grant of a license, not a transfer of title, and under this license you may not:

- Modifying or copying the materials
- Using the materials for any commercial purpose or for any public display
- Attempting to decompile or reverse engineer any software contained on the App
- Removing any copyright or other proprietary notations from the materials
- Transferring the materials to another person or "mirroring" the materials on any other server
- Violating any applicable laws or regulations

## 3. Disclaimer

The materials on Horizon are provided on an 'as is' basis. Horizon makes no warranties, expressed or implied, and hereby disclaims and negates all other warranties including, without limitation, implied warranties or conditions of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement of intellectual property or other violation of rights.

Further, Horizon does not warrant or make any representations concerning the accuracy, likely results, or reliability of the use of the materials on the Internet web site associated with such materials, or otherwise relating to such materials or on any sites linked to this site.

## 4. Limitations

In no event shall Horizon or its suppliers be liable for any damages (including, without limitation, damages for loss of data or profit, or due to business interruption) arising out of the use or inability to use the materials on Horizon, even if Horizon or an authorized representative has been notified orally or in writing of the possibility of such damage.

## 5. Accuracy of Materials

The materials appearing on Horizon could include technical, typographical, or photographic errors. Horizon does not warrant that any of the materials on the App are accurate, complete, or current. Horizon may make changes to the materials contained on the App at any time without notice.

## 6. Links

Horizon has not reviewed all of the sites linked to its Internet web site and is not responsible for the contents of any such linked site. The inclusion of any link does not imply endorsement by Horizon of the site. Use of any such linked web site is at the user's own risk.

## 7. Modifications

Horizon may revise these terms of service for the App at any time without notice. By using this App, you are agreeing to be bound by the then current version of these terms of service.

The App itself may be modified or discontinued at any time, with or without notice.

## 8. Governing Law

These terms and conditions are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the United States, and you irrevocably submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts in that location.

## 9. Data and Backup Responsibility

You are responsible for maintaining your own backups of any data stored within the App. While we make reasonable efforts to prevent data loss, you acknowledge that:

- Data stored locally on your device may be lost if the App is uninstalled or your device is reset
- You are responsible for enabling and maintaining any backup mechanisms (such as Google Drive sync)
- We are not responsible for data loss due to device failure, accidental deletion, or other user-caused issues

## 10. Google Drive Integration

Horizon uses Google Drive for optional cloud synchronization. Your use of Google Drive is governed by Google's Terms of Service. We do not have access to your Google Drive account except through the app's explicit authorization, which you may revoke at any time.

## 11. User Conduct

You agree not to:
- Use the App in any way that violates any applicable law or regulation
- Use the App to transmit any unlawful, threatening, abusive, defamatory, obscene, or otherwise objectionable material
- Use the App to harass, abuse, insult, harm, criticize, mock, demean or intimidate any individual or group
- Attempt to gain unauthorized access to any portion of the App

## 12. Contact Information

## 13. Privacy

Your use of Horizon is also governed by our Privacy Policy. Please review the Privacy Policy to understand our practices. In case of any conflict between these Terms of Service and the Privacy Policy, the Privacy Policy shall govern with respect to data collection and privacy practices.

**In Short**: Use Horizon responsibly, don't try to break it, keep your own backups, and understand we provide the app "as-is" without warranties. We can modify or discontinue it at any time.
